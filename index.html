<h3>Incompleteness in Description | 18.04.22</h3>
<h4>Kazik Grochowicz</h4>
<h5>
I begin by asserting that there is a difference between an accepted theory and a governing law. Even the most comprehesive theory is meerly a description of phenomena. The manifestation of phenomena is independent of its description.
<br>
<br>
The phenoma we observe and describe is irrefutably well-behaved. 
<br>
<br>
Suppose the universe is a deterministic system (of possibly infinite dimension). Then the phenoma which occur are products of particular initial conditions (possibly infinite), and it is almost certain that the manifestation of these phenomena is extremley sensitive to these initial conditions. Take Ed Lorenz's weather model, the quintessential sensitive deterministic system. It is only a three-dimensional system, and yet microscale adjustments to inital conditions result in chaotic behavior. Hence I argue that adjustments in initial conditions of a deterministc universe would have confounding effects. 
<br>
<br>
So a deterministic universe is sensitive to initial conditions, and we are currently in one of the infinitely (of possibly uncountable) many solution spaces under some set of initial conditions. This is what I would call <u>Incompleteness of Description (i)</u>. Even the most comprehensive description is specific to our solution space, out of possibly uncountably many. And thanks to sensitivity, an entirely new description would be required for every other solution space. This is distressing to an outcome driven agent at an exestential level.
<br>
<br>
But even in our particular solution space there is inherant incompletness of description. Phenomena may be governed by some peicewise function which fires Plank's Constant through a truely random number generator at some future time t, hence why I say, we are making observations and their respective descriptions of phenomena occuring in a well-behaved neighbourhood. Our best descriptions can never be shown to allign with governing laws absolutely. We can meerly watch our best descriptions behave resiliently under perterbations (our timescale) in this neighbourhood. And unlike the talk of vacuum decay completely changing the governing laws or strange matter escaping neutron stars, we truely have no idea if or when we will be exited from our well behaved neighbourhood. I would call this <u>Incompleteness of Description (ii)</u>. We are describing what has been observed, as if the phenomena will not change suddenly by some mechanism which we cannot describe. Sudden radical change of physical phenomena, prompted by seemingly nothing. If this was fiction I would go so far as to call the wave-function sentient and malevolent. This should be frightening, more so than vacuum decay, because it is the possibility of attack from the unknown which is absolutely unexpected and irreversible.
