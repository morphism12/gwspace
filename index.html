<h3>Incompleteness in Description | 18.04.22</h3>
<h4>Kazik Grochowicz</h4>
<h5>
I begin by asserting that there is a difference between an accepted theory and a governing law. Even the most comprehesive theory is meerly a description of phenomena. The manifestation of phenomena is independent of its description.
<br>
<br>
The phenoma we observe and describe is irrefutably well-behaved. 
<br>
<br>
Suppose the universe is a deterministic system (of possibly infinite dimension). Then the phenoma which occur are products of particular initial conditions (possibly infinite), and it is almost certain that the manifestation of these phenomena is extremley sensitive to these initial conditions. Take Ed Lorenz's weather model, the quintessential sensitive deterministic system. It is only a three-dimensional system, and yet microscale adjustments to inital conditions result in chaotic behavior. Hence I argue that adjustments in initial conditions of a deterministc universe would confounding effects. 
<br>
<br>
So a deterministic universe is sensitive to initial conditions, and we are currently in one of the infinitely (of possibly uncountable) many solution spaces under some set of initial conditions. This is what I would call <u>Incompletness of Description (i)</u>. Even the most comprehensive description is specific to our solution space, out of possibly uncountably many. And thanks to sensitivity, an entirely new description would be required for every other solution space. This is distressing to an outcome driven agent at an exestential level.
