<h3>Incompleteness in Description | 18.04.22</h3>
<h4>Kazik Grochowicz</h4>
<h5>Do theorists make the distiction between decription and governance? Clearly a theory is a decription of phenomena and not a governing law of phenomena, but despite the severity of this distinction, after a series of perfect descriptions it is easy to take a theory as a governing law.
<br> <br>
Descriptions which are "perfect" are meerly resilient in a well-behaved neighbourhood. For all we know, the system could be a piecewise staircase which fires into 


I would be weary of "perfect" descriptions. These descriptions are not "perfect", but meerly resilient under perterbations in an extremely well-behaved neighbourhood.  

<br><br>

So there is incompleteness, in a Goedel sense, in theoretical description. 

<br><br>

But what really is the purpose of the description? Higher understanding or sufficient accuracy and precision for human application? That is, epistemic or instrumental? In the latter case, none of this matters - forget what really is fringe behavior and match the data. But in the former case, this is ignorance at the highest degree. </h5>
